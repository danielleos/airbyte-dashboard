Dashboard to display data from an OpenAPI

Using [JikanAPI](https://jikan.moe/) which is the unofficial API for MyAnimeList (MAL) anime database.

### Requirements
- Choose an Open API or use one of the following: http://www.omdbapi.com/, https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation?ref=apilist.fun - however, we will accept any if you would like to try something else.
- At least 3 separate data points (e.g. number of films, average film length) displayed in different ways (e.g. large bold number, % bar fill, pie chart)
- An ordered list with search/filter (e.g. films in a specific genre)
- Be creative, although we aren't testing your design skills, we would like to see an attempt to make the interface look aesthetically pleasing.

### Submission
- Please submit the code via GitHub (or similar).
- We will also require a demo page to look at your work.
- There is no specific deadline but before the end of the week would be great.
